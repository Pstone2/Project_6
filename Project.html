<p>The goal of the project is to create and train a genetic algorithm to find and mine a diamond in the popular game Minecraft.</p>
<h2 id="minerl-library">MineRL Library</h2>
<p>The project will rely heavily on the MineRL library. MineRL allows users to run a free modified version of Minecraft provided by Microsoft that has been designed specifically to work with the MineRL library.</p>
<h3 id="visualization">Visualization</h3>
<p>The previously discussed MineRL library allows users to run the simulations headlessly, without a visualization, to increase computational speed. In addition the simulation can run the modified version of Minecraft provided by Microsoft and show the agent preforming the desired actions.</p>
<h2 id="genetic-algorithms">Genetic Algorithms</h2>
<p>A genetic algorithm is a form of machine learning where the algorithm is given a task to compleate and then scored on how well they are compleating the task. Generally, how the model is scored is considered the fitness of the model. After running the model many times, the most fit model is selected as the basis for the next generation of modles. This process is repeated until the model has learned to compleate the task to the disired level.</p>
<h3 id="example">Example</h3>
<p>For example, a genetic algorithm designed to drive a car across a level in two dimensions could have its fitness be graded on the distance from the starting point the car is able to make it to in a given amount of timeâ€¦</p>
<h2 id="importance">Importance</h2>
<p>While Minecraft is a videogame, it is the complexity of the problem that is important. In short, Minecraft is a sandbox game where every world is randomly generated and the path to the objective, mining diamonds, envolves many steps that do not inherntly appear to make progress towards getting diamonds. The overall concepts of making a genetic algorithm that is able to efficently do a task given random changing environment can have many real world applications.</p>
<h2 id="data">Data</h2>
<p>Tha data to train the model will be provided by the MineRL website which works in collaboration with Microsoft. If time permits, creating my own dataset from my gameplay would be a fun exersize.</p>
